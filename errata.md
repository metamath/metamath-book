# Errata

The following are errata for the Metamath 2019 ("Second Edition") book
dated 2019-06-02. Issues marked with an asterisk (*) have not yet been
fixed in the repository version of the book.

* Preface (page x) - "able follow a proof" should be "able to follow a proof".
* Preface (page xiv, Note on Bibliography and Index) - "find it in on" should
  be "find it on".
* Preface (Note Added March 7, 2019) - Matamath --> Metamath
* Section 1.1.1 (page 4) - "allows you do" should be "allows you to do".
* Section 1.1.6 (page 20) - "may be correspond" should be "may correspond".
* Section 1.3.2 (page 27) - "a way that can not only able to" should be "a way

* *Section 2.4 (page 52) and further shows this text after some assign commands:
  "To undo the assignment, DELETE STEP ... and INITIALIZE, UNIFY if needed."
  This text is no longer shown.
  When the first edition of the book was written, metamath.exe didn't have
  the 'undo'/'redo' commands (added in 2013; see 'help undo'), so hints
  were provided by some commands for how to undo them manually.
  These hints are no longer displayed since they are no longer needed.
* Section 2.4 (page 53) - "examples where is it used" should be "examples
  where it is used".
* Section 3.1 (page 60) - "allow us determine" should be "allow us to
  determine". In the same paragraph, "allows to say" should be "allows us to
  say".
* Section 3.2.2 (page 67) - "auxilliary" should be "auxiliary".
* Section 3.2.4 (page 70) - "Tarsky-Grothendieck" should be
  "Tarski-Grothendieck".
* *Section 3.3.2 and 3.3.3 headings (page 71) - the headings go past
  the intended margin (though they're quite readable).
* Section 3.4.3 (page 82) - "Similar to definition on" should be "Similar
  to the definition on".
* Section 3.9.3 (page 97) - "appraoch" should be "approach".
* *Section 3.10 (page 103 and 104) - the output of "show statement ax-1/full"
  is shown twice (once at the end of page 103, and once at the top of
  page 104).
* Section 3.10.1 (page 109) - "may be be slightly" should be "may be
  slightly".
* Section 4.1.3 (page 114) - "scope nd" should be "scope and".
* Section 4.2.5 (page 127) - "are also valid class expression" should be "are
  also valid class expressions".
* Section 4.3 (page 138) - "Historically `show proof` command did" should be
  "Historically the `show proof` command did".
  There is also a superfluous comma: "... option to hide, them, but today ...".
* Section 4.3.1 (page 139) - "used and that each $f hypothesis have"
  should be "used, and each $f hypothesis must have".
* Section 4.4.1 (page 142) - "parenticals" should be "parentheticals".

  "and another uses" should be "and another that uses", and "bibiographic"
  should be "bibliographic".

  "Every dummy variable in the definiendum are required to" should be
  "All dummy variables in the definiendum are required to".

* *Chapter 5 mentions the minimize command, but does not describe it
  in detail. A future version of the book might describe it in more detail.
* Section 5.2.9 (page 161) - "lets you to change" should be "lets you change".
* Section 5.6 (page 168) - In "The undo command if very helpful",
  the "if" should be "is".
* Section 5.6.3 `set empty_substitution` Command (page 171) -
  there's a duplication and the second bracketed text could be removed.
  It says:
  "(An example where this must be on would
  be a system that implements a Deduction Rule and in which deductions from
  empty assumption lists would be permissible. The MIU-system described in
  Appendix D is another example.) Note that empty substitutions are always
  permissible in proof verification (VERIFY PROOF...) outside the Proof
  Assistant. (See the MIU system in the Metamath book for an example of
  a system needing empty substitutions; another example would be a system
  that implements a Deduction Rule and in which deductions from empty
  assumption lists would be permissible.)"
* Section 5.6.11 (page 174) - "and to do `save new_proof` frequently" should be
  "and do `save new_proof` frequently".
* Appendix A (page 184) - Part of the description of the uniqueness quantifier
  is "there is at least one x". It should be "there is exactly one x".
* Appendix C (page 192) - "declared to be say, a string" should be "declared
  to be, say, a string".
